# Capture the Flag (CTF)

Hackers often hold CTF competitions to see who is the best at hacking a closed system like a set of folders and files in a limited amount of time. We will hold a legit CTF competition (with prizes!) in a moment after we have gone over the instructions together and learned a few things, so that it can be as fair as possible.

## Instructions
<ol>
  <li>
    You are required to work with a partner. There may be one group of 3 if there is an odd number of students in the class.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your team has at least 2 students from different grade levels, you will start the competition with one extra flag worth 1 point.
  </li>
  <li>Flags are worth 1,2,3, or 4 points depending on how hard they are to find.</li>
  <li>You will need to use some Bash commands to find the flags. They are all listed below, with explanations of what they do.</li>
</ol>
