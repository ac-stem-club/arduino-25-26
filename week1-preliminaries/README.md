# Week 1: Preliminaries

## Overview 
This week, we will learn the basics of how to use our Arduino boards, write and document code. <br><br>
This lesson has 3 parts, and by the end of today you will have coded in two languages! First, you will learn how to write documents in Markdown which will help you record your ideas. Next, you'll learn the basics of C++ Arduino code so that we can jump into coding without any worries. Finally, you'll wire your first circuit and practice writing some code for it.<br><br><b>Important: </b> If you need help from Mr. Burke, please write your name at the bottom of the list on the board. After you are called for help, erase your name from the top of the list. Computer Scientists would call this a <b>first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue</b>. You can also ask students for help and work in partners.
