# Week 1: Preliminaries

## Overview
This week, we will learn the basics of how to use our Arduino boards, write and document code. 

<br><br>
This lesson has 3 parts, and by the end of the week you will have coded in three new languages: Markdown, C++, and Bash! The first project to learn the basics is broken down as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Learn how to use Markdown to write professional-looking code documents!</li>
  <li>Learn how C++ code works! This will help us prevent common errors so we can jump into coding with success!</li>
  <li>Capture the Flag (CTF): Use what you learned in parts 1-2 to solve riddles and quests. CTF competitions are very popular with hackers. This is an easier version of a real one!</li>
  <li>Wire your first Arduino circuit and write C++ code for it!</li>
</ol>

<br><br><b>Important: </b> If you need help from Mr. Burke, please write your name at the bottom of the list on the board. After you are called for help, erase your name from the top of the list. Computer Scientists would call this a <b>first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue</b>. You can also ask students for help and work in partners.

## Instructions: 
For each part (1-4) above, all of the files you need are in the folders <code>part1</code>, <code>part2</code>, <code>part3</code> and <code>part4</code>. Inside each folder, there is document called <code>NOTES.md</code> where you can put your notes and answers!
