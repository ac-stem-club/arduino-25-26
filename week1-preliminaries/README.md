# Week 1: Preliminaries

## Overview 
This week, we will learn the basics of how to use our Arduino boards, write and document code. <br><br>
This lesson has 3 parts, and by the end of today you will have coded in two languages! First, you will learn how to write documents in Markdown which will help you record your ideas. Next, you'll learn the basics of C++ Arduino code so that we can jump into coding without any worries. Finally, you'll wire your first circuit and practice writing some code for it.
