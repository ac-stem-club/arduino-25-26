## linebreaks
You can edit Markdown files in GitHub by clicking the pencil icon in the top right of this box. Going into edit mode will show you the code that was used to render the nice-looking Markdown file.

You can put breaks between paragraphs using the `<br>` element. Anywhere where Markdown sees `<br>` will be turned into a new line when you click <b>Commit changes...</b> in the green box. Try it below! Add `<br>` elements to format the letter properly.

## bold and italic
You can make any bit of text <b>bold</b> by wrapping it in the `<b>` and `</b>` tags. For example, if we write <code>hello</code>, then it won't be bold, but <code><b>hello</b></code> will be!
