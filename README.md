# Welcome to STEM Club 2025-2026!!!
What is this page? It is called a <ul>README</ul> file, and is written in a simple language called <ul>Markdown</ul>.
<br>
You can make a Markdown file anywhere inside of GitHub and once you click <ul>Commit changes...</ul> to upload the file, GitHub will <u>render</u> your Markdown code into a fancy document!!
