## How to Use Our GitHub Classroom Page
These lessons are free and open-source and developed by yours truly. Each of the folders in this repository are labeled with the project and week we will be completing it (for example, <code>week2-mission-launch-controls</code>). Each folder contains a README file with a link to any applicable slides, as well as code files (the ones that end in <i>.ino</i>). Please feel free to follow along on your own at home, even if you're not in STEM Club! You will need:
<br><br>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/EL-KIT-001-Project-Complete-Starter-Tutorial/dp/B01CZTLHGE/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2F9XM34HB2I1U&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.mZ64xWPEYV5jxuInUAX0ri5lHi0YqZR9lOaIhkzAoPej-_xK8JTzr9RIQ9gWK6l3K670dpBJyUMmWIznraoe3CgIMsdColstLMwvG6w1mywRTuoXaeL42-9bMXEZS2RVQ8Ur4hAjJOGxWJsKWl_hQ72cXibCzBrzFagwm6uzmtrxVsVmA1JjDKablxVGf7WGg5h-zfKgkWWa9XpOjZtBDYoM98jI4O7XaIw3dVZ-q8Q.sYtSK_yT3LKZrryPY0N5VjBHR6IOhinn1-Bzs0My4Pk&dib_tag=se&keywords=elegoo+most+complete+starter+kit&qid=1761519509&sprefix=elegoo+most+com%2Caps%2C226&sr=8-1">The Elegoo Most Complete Starter Kit</a></li>
<li>Optional, but helpful: <a href="http://archive.org/details/arduino_projects_book"><i>Arduino Projects Book</i>, Fitzgerald and Shiloh</li></a> This is the book I am basing most of the projects on.</li>
<li>A computer to write code on. Windows, Mac, and Linux computers can download the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/">Arduino Code Editor desktop program</a> and chromebooks can run the <a href="https://app.arduino.cc/sketches?custom_banner=cloud_banner">Arduino Cloud IDE code editor</a> in place of the desktop program.</li>
</ul>


## Why GitHub?
GitHub is basically just Google Drive but for coding. We will use it to: <ul>
<li>Store and access project materials. Each of the folders in this <b>Repository</b> (big folder of code and files) are labeled <code>week1-...</code>, <code>week2-...</code>, <code>week3-...</code>, and so on. Everything you'll need is inside of them.</li>
<li>Collaborate on code with your partner(s) and Mr. Burke. You can access and work on your code from any computer by logging into our class webpage at <https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/238337690-ac-stem-club-classroom> using your Arie Crown student email.</li>
<li>Editing code online! GitHub will even highlight key words in your code. <b>Note:</b> you cannot run your code on GitHub, so you will need to copy or <b>pull</b> it to the Arduino code editor.</li>
</ul>
This page is especially useful for if you miss a class or you want to show other people what you're learning. In general, all materials for each week will be listed in the folders contained in this repository.

  
## Markdown
What is this page? It is called a <b>README</b> file, and is written in a simple language called <b>Markdown</b>. Pretty much all software comes with a README file which tells you how to use it. Next time you download a new application on your computer, try looking for the README!
<br><br>
You can create a Markdown file anywhere in GitHub by making its filename end in <code>.md</code> (for example, <code>my_file.md</code>). Once you click <b>Commit changes...</b> to upload the file, GitHub will <b>render</b> your Markdown code into a fancy document!! Try clicking the button labeled <code>Raw</code> at the top of this box to see what the code looks like! It's very simple to learn.
