## How to Use Our GitHub Classroom Page
GitHub is basically just Google Drive but for coding. We will use it to: <ul>
<li>Store and access project materials. Each of the folders in this <b>Repository</b> (big folder of code and files) are labeled <code>project1-...</code>, <code>project2-...</code>, <code>project3-...</code>, and so on. Everything you'll need is inside of them.</li>
<li>Collaborate on code with your partner(s) and Mr. Burke. You can access and work on your code from any computer by logging into our class webpage at <https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/238337690-ac-stem-club-classroom> using your Arie Crown student email.</li>
<li>Editing code online! GitHub will even highlight key words in your code. <b>Note:</b> you cannot run your code on GitHub, so you will need to copy or <b>pull</b> it to the Arduino code editor.</li>
</ul>
  
## Markdown
What is this page? It is called a <b>README</b> file, and is written in a simple language called <b>Markdown</b>.
<br><br>
You can make a Markdown file anywhere inside of GitHub and once you click <b>Commit changes...</b> to upload the file, GitHub will <b>render</b> your Markdown code into a fancy document!!
